## What We'll Learn Tomorrow

1. **GitHub Actions Basics**
   - Workflows and triggers
   - Running tests automatically
   - Deploying on push

2. **GCP Integration**
   - Service account authentication
   - Terraform in CI/CD
   - Automated deployments

3. **Best Practices**
   - Testing before deploy
   - Environment separation
   - Rollback strategies

## Prerequisites Completed ✅

- ✅ GCP account set up
- ✅ Terraform working locally
- ✅ GitHub repository ready
- ✅ Project structure organized

## Tomorrow's Plan

1. Create GitHub Actions workflow
2. Set up GCP service account for CI/CD
3. Automate Terraform deployments
4. Add testing pipeline
5. Deploy automatically on push to main

## Notes

- We'll skip the Cloud Functions issues for now
- Focus on CI/CD concepts (universal skills)
- Can revisit deployment with Cloud Run later
- The IaC knowledge transfers directly
